# KickScore
# IoT-Based Smart Football Game

This project is an interactive **IoT Football Game Prototype** built using Arduino components.  
It automatically detects goals using **ultrasonic sensors**, updates live scores on an **LCD display**, and controls **servo motors** to simulate player movement.  

## ðŸš€ Features

- Automatic goal detection using **ultrasonic sensors**
- Real-time score display on **16x2 I2C LCD**
- **Servo-controlled players** that move continuously during play
- Game ends automatically when a player scores 5 goals
- Compact and fully automated design with easy setup
